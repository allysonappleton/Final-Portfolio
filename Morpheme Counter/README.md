Here are instructions for using the "morpheme_counter" code:

1. Copy the code and paste it into an R script or console.
2. Call the function by typing "morpheme_counter" followed by parentheses.
3. Inside the parentheses, provide the word you want to analyze as a character string (in quotes). 
- For example, to analyze the word "unhappy", type: morpheme_counter("unhappy")

The function will then output the number of morphemes in the word you provided.
