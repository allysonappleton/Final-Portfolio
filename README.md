# Final-Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my Final Portfolio! This repository is a valuable resource for linguists, language students, and teachers seeking helpful tools and resources to assist with text analysis. It is comprised of three projects I created: Consonant Cluster Hunter, an interactive Shiny app designed to identify word initial, word medial, and word final consonant clusters in text using regular expressions; Introductory Lesson on Regular Expressions, a comprehensive swirl course that introduces users to the stringr package and the use of regular expressions in R; and lastly, Morpheme Counter, an advanced function that counts the number of morphemes in a word.

Here are some helpful intructions on how to access each project:
1. Visit my GitHub repository: Final-Porfolio (the link from my website, will bring you right here!)
2. In the upper-right hand corner, click on the "Fork" button to get your own copy of the respository.

To load a forked repository  into RStudio, you can follow these steps:
- Once you have the cloned repository, open RStudio.
- Click on the "File" menu and select "New Project" â†’ "Version Control" 
- Choose "Git" as the type of version control system.
- In the "Repository URL" field, paste the URL of your forked repository, and make sure to type .git at the end of the URL 
- Choose a directory where you want to save the project on your computer.
- Click on "Create Project" to create the project.
- That's it, you now have access to all projects! You can now start working with the project files in RStudio.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!ðŸ˜Š I hope that each tool and resource I have created will assist you in your linguistic pursuits.
