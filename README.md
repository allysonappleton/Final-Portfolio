# Final-Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my Final Portfolio! This repository is a valuable resource for linguists, language students, and teachers seeking helpful tools and resources to assist with text analysis. It is comprised of three projects I created: Consonant Cluster Hunter, an interactive Shiny app designed to identify word initial, word medial, and word final consonant clusters in text using regular expressions; Introductory Lesson on Regular Expressions, a comprehensive swirl course that introduces users to the stringr package and the use of regular expressions in R; and lastly, Morpheme Counter, an advanced function that counts the number of morphemes in a word.

Here are some helpful intructions on how to access each project:
1. Visit my GitHub repository: Final-Porfolio (the link from my website, will bring you right here!)
2. In the upper-right hand corner, click on the fork button to get your own copy of the respository.
3. That's it, you now have access to all projects!

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!ðŸ˜Š I hope that each tool and resource I have created will assist you in your linguistic pursuits.
