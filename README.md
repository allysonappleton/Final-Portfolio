# Final-Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my Final Portfolio! This repository is a valuable resource for linguists, language students, and teachers seeking helpful tools and resources to assist with text analysis. It is comprised of three projects I created: Consonant Cluster Hunter, an interactive Shiny app designed to identify word initial, word medial, and word final consonant clusters in text using regular expressions; Introductory Lesson on Regular Expressions, a comprehensive swirl course that introduces users to the stringr package and the use of regular expressions in R; and lastly, Morpheme Counter, an advanced function that counts the number of morphemes in a word.

Here are some helpful intructions on how to access each project:
1. Visit the GitHub website and navigate to my profile page (which you're already on!).
2. Click on the Repositories tab to access the list of repositories.
3. Click on the Final-Portfolio repository to access the project.
4. To run each project, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file located in each project folder. The README.md file provides an overview of each project, along with step-by-step instructions on how to run the project.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!ðŸ˜Š I hope that each tool and resource I have created will assist you in your linguistic pursuits.
